 Since the HomeViewController will only use the closetStation. This ViewModel will only contain a single Station along with a single North Bound Train (EstimateDeparture) and a single South Bound Train (EstimateDeparture)
 The properties are optional due to being reliant on whether or not the user gave location permissions. However, regardless of permissions it will contain a list of Stations.
